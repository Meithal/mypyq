# Mypyq

This is a rewrite of https://github.com/TheSil/mpyq.
It should yield better results with "hostile" mpq's such as protected war3 maps.
See the original project for rationale.

For alternative PKWARE explode, you can compile https://github.com/Meithal/zlib/tree/master/contrib/blast which was fixed to work on Windows and uncomment the lines that deal with pkware decompression.
